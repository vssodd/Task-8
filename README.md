# Task-8

Task-8 includes a series of interactive Python programs focused on text processing, string manipulation, and simple data computations. The tasks cover:

Counting specific words in user input.

Finding positions of special characters.

Simulating arrangements and patterns using loops and string concatenations.

Implementing a rover movement simulator on a bounded grid.

Calculating the length of the longest word in a text.

Computing totals based on character positions in input strings.

Decrypting messages through character reordering.

Checking whether a string is a palindrome.

Each program emphasizes user input handling, iteration, conditional logic, and string operations, providing practical exercises in fundamental programming concepts.
